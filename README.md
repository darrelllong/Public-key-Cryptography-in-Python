## Primality Testing

A primality test is an algorithm for determining whether an input
number is prime. Unlike integer factorization, primality tests do
not generally yield the prime factors, only whether the input number
is prime. Factorization is thought to be a computationally *hard*
problem. While at the same time, primality testing has been recently shown to
require polynomial
time. It is polynomial in the size of the input (the logarithm of the
cardinality of the number). Some primality tests prove that a number
is prime, while others like probabilistic Miller‚ÄìRabin prove that a number is
composite.

The simplest primality test is trial division: given an input number,
*n*, check whether it is evenly divisible by any prime number between
2 and ‚àö*n*. If there is no remainder, then *n* is composite; else, it
is prime. Of course, trial division is infeasible for large integers.

Probabilistic tests provide provable bounds on the probability of
being fooled by a composite number. Many popular primality tests
are probabilistic tests. Apart from the tested number *n*, these tests
use some other numbers *a*, called *witnesses*, which are chosen at random from some
sample space; the usual randomized primality tests never report a
prime number as composite, but a composite number can be reported
as prime. Repeating the test can reduce the probability of error
by using several independently chosen values of *a*.

Implemented here are:
* Solovay-Strassen
* Miller-Rabin

# Utility Routines
This implementation gives you the choice of using *safe primes* for *p* and *q*. This can be
a little slow, but you do not need to do this more than once.

```
@misc{cryptoeprint:2001:007,
    author       = {Ronald Rivest and Robert Silverman},
    title        = {Are 'Strong' Primes Needed for {RSA}?},
    howpublished = {Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2001/007},
    year         = {2001},
    note         = {\url{https://ia.cr/2001/007}},
}
```

This implementation provides these utilities (these provide the same functionality as some built-ins, but the point is to teach):
* `is_odd(x)` and `is_even(x)`
* `power(a, e)`
* `power_mod(a, e, n)`
* `perfect_power(n)`
* `is_prime_MR(n, k)`
* `is_prime_SS(n, k)`
* `is_prime(n, k)` = `is_prime_MR(n, k)` ‚àß `is_prime_SS(n, k)`
* `random_prime(low, high, k)`
* `safe_prime(low, high, k)`
* `rabin_prime(low, high safety)`
* `extended_GCD(a, b)`
* `gcd(a, b)`
* `lcm(a, b)`
* `inverse(a, n)`
* `group_generator(n, p)`
